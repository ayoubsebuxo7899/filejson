Each has their own goal: the daddy's goal is to ensure that the baby makes it to the end of the round, while the baby's goal is to sustain injury. Contrary to convention, this is a game where one of the players is rewarded for getting hurt."

         "description":"the gameplay is different for each player. The player controlling the baby must avoid the daddy and find a means of sustaining damage using household objects. The player controlling the daddy must stop the baby at all turns, blocking off dangerous objects and obtaining special abilities through performing certain actions. As any parent knows, there are plenty of dangers around the household, and the game portrays this. The baby character can stick a fork in an electrical socket, climb into an oven, fall into a full bathtub, or drink hazardous chemicals. The father can prevent these disasters using special objects such as outlet covers"
