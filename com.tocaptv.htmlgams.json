         "description":"You need your previously purchased Toca Life apps installed on the same device as Toca Life: World. They need to be up-to-date so make sure there’s no update available on the App Store/ Google Play/ Amazon Appstore. Visit the shop in Toca Life World.. At the top of the shop you’ll see the  symbols next to the locations of the Toca Life apps you have installed on device. Tap on one at a time (if several) and then it should show add instead of buy and click this to add the content of the app to the World map.. Now you should see everything being built up on the map in Toca Life World."

         "description":"We put a lot of time, love and effort into making our apps as magical and fun as they are. Therefore we have to charge a small amount to be able to continue making more fantastic apps, and also to be able to pay our amazing team. They’re doing a great job! Hope you find it worth the money No! We believe safety should come first which is why we don’t have any third party advertising in any of our products.On the starting screen of each app, there is a small icon, usually showing one of our latest releases or perhaps an app that is temporarily on sale or free. If you want to disable the feature, it’s easily done in your device’s Settings panel – just locate the Toca apps on the list there and toggle to off"

         "description":"This seamless collection of locations, objects, and characters for open-ended imaginative play is limited mostly by how much money you want to spend. Toca Life fans will love the opportunity to collect all their worlds in one place. It's easy now to pop into the stable, go on vacation, visit the hairdresser, and stop by the office. There's opportunity here to create a huge, interconnected world -- that is, if you want to pay for it. The free download includes quite a bit of content. And those who've already bought apps in the Toca Life series have even more of a head start. But even so, growing this world requires a bit of an investment, which could make Toca Life World: Build Stories feel like a push to buy, buy, buy. It's important to note that the developer included a way to turn off the shopping icon, which gives parents a great option for avoiding this pitfall. And though it looks great to keep adding to the world"

         "description":"TA few things to note:You can only flip furniture, so it’s not possible to flip smaller items/decorationsIt's not possible to flip furniture that is symmetrical (i.e anything that would look the same even if you flipped it)There are certain types of furniture items that aren’t flippable (TV’s and other items with animations)Most items with text aren’t flippable Super secret tip - if it’s got a white line around it and it’s not symmetrical, then you should be able to flip it. If it’s got a black outline around it, it’s not flippable.We’re always open to suggestions though, so if there’s something you’re thirsting to flip, then click the “Contact Us” button in the top right and let us know what you think should be flippable (ideally provide a screenshot of the item)"
